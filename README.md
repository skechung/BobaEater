# BobaEater
Started at a workshop for the 2020 SIGCSE Conference:

A little sprite game where you eat boba and run away from the enemy!

## Inspiration
I thought it would be fun to make a mini "console" game in which a character runs around and eats boba (since at the time, I couldn't go outside and eat boba myself due to lockdown).
